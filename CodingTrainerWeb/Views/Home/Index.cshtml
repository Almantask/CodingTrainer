        <h2>Road Map</h2>
        <p>
            This code runner is not intended to stand alone. It is the start of a much more grand project, which is a
            programming tutor. Unlike the many other online tutorial videos that are available, having the website process
            the learners code means that the code can be analysed by the server, and individual feedback given to the
            learner, either automatically generated or by a human.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other plans include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
            <li>Compiler error highlighting</li>
            <li>Basic  debugging</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h2>Instructions for use</h2>
        <p>There are currently two ways of running code:</p>
        <p>
            The first is simply to write the required C# instructions directly into the code windows. The demonstration
            code that loads when you go to the Run Code page demonstrates how to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second method is to write a <code>public static void Main()</code> method, just as you would in full
            C#. However, unlike full C#, the method should not be inside a class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other classes and methods can be added as required (methods can be either inside or outside a class). Console
            output is displayed in a seperate window. There is also a text box which can be used for console input. Many
            other features of the language have been disabled, and there are no plans to add most language features that
            are currently disabled because the ultimate aim of this project is that it will be used for basic training in
            computer programming, not for running advanced language features.

        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Maximum of 5 seconds of processor time per script.</li>
            <li>Total maximum running time of 5 minutes per script.</li>
            <li>Maximum 5MB of heap memory per script.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stack overflows are not currently handled.</li>
            <li>
                Code which hangs in a <code>finally</code> block (e.g. infinite loops) will result in the program hanging
                when the code times out.
            </li>
            <li>The memory restriction enforment is not very reliable.</li>
        </ul>
