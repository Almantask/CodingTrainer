# CodingTrainer
Website for people to train in computer programming

A work in progress - currently this project only includes a code-runner, which runs the user's code and displays output.

It will eventually include tutorials, code-checkeers to check whether a user has passed an exercise, and automated help generation for
users needing guidance when writing their code.
